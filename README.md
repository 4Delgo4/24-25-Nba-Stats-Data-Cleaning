# 24-25-Nba-Stats-Data-Cleaning
A show of my data Cleaning and formatting skills. Grabbed a dataset from Kaggle with Raw Unformatted Data games played during the from the beginning of the season to January 25th, 2025. 

There is missing data from the Original dataset as I have verfied by cross refrencing with the NBA site, So running statistics on it would not be very accurate
But you could use it to put into a model to see if you can predict stats at the end of the season.
